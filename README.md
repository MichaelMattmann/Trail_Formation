## General Introduction

We want to simulate the trajectories chosen from the peoples while walking on a grass meadow. 
it's quite an important topic, because it helps planning streets, so that the road network is more efficient. We think it's very interesting because it has a lot in common whit all day life since we can find this trails on every park of a city.
it's interesting also because it's not evident to solve since it depends on many factors that can not be controlled. 


## The Model

The most important variable it the ground structure, which includes the morphology depending on the position and the presence of tracks depending on time and position. 
In addition there is the durability of tracks (regeneration of nature), attractiveness and visibility of a determined place. 
We plan to measure the presence of tracks by adding all contributions of the people walking on that specific place and subtracting the regeneration ratio. Attractiveness depends on the presence of tracks, the visibility and the direction of the destination. 
This model won't consider the social influence and the "force" acting between two peoples walking at the same time, but we think it's a good model because it involves most of the criteria needed to decide the trajectory.


## Fundamental Questions

How trajectories form?
What happens if there is no trail yet?
What happens when two trails cross? 
What happens if we add another destination without tracks to that destination?
Which track is going to disappear?
How does morphology influence the final network?


## Expected Results

We expect that at the beginning the direct trajectories are chosen, but as time passes this will change. At the moment we don't know how.

We plan to use the model proposed in this reference, but adding the ground morphology. It's also possible to add social behaviour and "forces" between peoples. 


## Research Methods

This model is based on two dynamic differential equations.
